## ❓ FAQ

**Q: A website I use is broken. What do I do?**
A: This is expected. You need to find the blocked domain and add it to your AdGuard "allowlist" or "whitelist". Use AdGuard's blocking log to identify the culprit.

**Q: How often is this list updated?**
A: It is updated manually on an irregular basis, typically when major new threats emerge or source lists are significantly improved.

**Q: Can I request a domain to be added or removed?**
A: No. This is a personal project curated based on my own standards for privacy and security.
